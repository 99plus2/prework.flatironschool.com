        <h3>The Flatiron School's Prework</h3>

<p>In this document you’re going to find a ton of reading, videos, and quizzes that Flatiron students complete before their semester even begins. We thought we'd open source this material. We suggest going through this material linearly because it really represents a progressive journey through fundementals and abstractions. Enjoy.</p>

<p>The main topics we want you to know about before the semester starts are: Internet Basics, Command-Line Interface, Git Version Control, SQL and Databases, HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have 0 prior knowledge on the topic. In total, if you are coming to this with absolutely no experience, as in, you’d have trouble articulating what
is, then I estimate this work will take you between 80 - 100 hours to complete. If you are a rockstar, this shouldn’t take more than a 6-10 hours. Most of you are somewhere in between.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with the topic, I highly suggest trying to take the quiz or challenge first. If you pass easily and collect the badge, great, move on. That being said, even I found myself learning new things during this assessment, so maybe try to watch the videos on the topics with which you are most unfamiliar.</p>

<p>I’ve also added some optional resources. If you are familiar with the required material, take a stab at the optional and advanced topics. The goal in the next 4 months is to immerse yourself in as much technology as possible.</p>

<p>In terms of reading and watching videos, feel free to skip through - go for overall coverage as opposed to depth - try to read and watch as much as possible and then try to take the quiz. Be quick, and then do a 2nd round of reading and watching</p>

<p>Also, if you find yourself stuck, or stuff doesn’t make sense, or things are taking way longer than I thought they would, please email me! I’d love to keep track of your progress and what you’re working on, the purpose of this assessment is simply to see where we all stand and give you all a chance to get caught up on some basic skills.</p>

<p>The goal in the end is for you to submit your Code School and Treehouse profiles and for me to see that you’ve completed all the required badges and assessments that are listed below.</p>

<p>INTERNET BASICS</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE</p>

<p>Familiarity with a shell environment is crucial to being a functional developer. There are no good interactive tutorials for command lines, so you will have to complete the following reading:</p>

<p>HTML &amp; CSS Tutorial: 3 Hours 
This is a beautiful guide that I recommend everyone read through as quickly as possible. Don’t worry if you don’t fully grok this, the Treehouse unit below covers all this through videos and tests.
